# Before You Start

1. **Define your Objective**  
   Decide what matters most for your team—cash or leaderboard position. Your approach and submission should align with this objective (e.g., risk-averse vs. risk-seeking).  
   - **Prize-only mindset (ICM)**  
     - You only care about the payout.  
     - This year only ranks 1–25 receive a prize; finishing 26th is same as 10,000th.  
   - **Ranking-focused mindset (Chip/Seashell EV)**  
     - You value climbing the leaderboard (bragging rights, potential job leads, etc.).  

2. **Leverage the "Freeroll"**  
   No entry cost = no real downside—unless you name your team after your alma mater.  
   - Pro Tip: To hedge against emotional loss, name your team after your rival school. That way, if you blow up, it’s their reputation on the line.

3. **Poker Analogy**  
   Treat the competition like a poker tournament, where seashells are your stack and the prize pool is the payout structure.  
   - **Chip/Seashell EV (Expected Value / Alphas)**  
     - Positive Chip EV is like finding an "alpha"—a strategy that earns you more shells.  
   - **ICM (Independent Chip Model)**  
     - Converts your chip count into its real-money worth.  
     - Creates "ICM pressure" late in the game—sometimes preserving your position is better than risking a large chip swing (even if the move has positive Chip EV).
